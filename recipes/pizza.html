    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This delicious italian dish is a favorite of mine, which is why I would love to share with you
        a recipe my italian grandmother used to make when I was a kid.
    </p>
    <p>
        This dish is appropriate for intermediate cooks; let's say it's more difficult than baking an egg, 
        but less difficult than making a huge feast.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tblsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>1 small onion</li>
        <li>800g crushed tomato</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>4 tblsp salt</li>
        <li>Handful basil leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 2 â€“ 3 minutes until translucent. Add tomato, water, salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Stir, reduce heat to medium, simmer for 5 minutes. Optional: add 1/2 cup water and blend sauce until smooth (I do this for guests!).</li>
        <li>Stir through basil or dried herbs. Set aside.</li>
    </ol>
